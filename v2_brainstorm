## Improvements

x - in all send methods, can pass binary as payload (skip serialization)
x - Encode packets as they enter the queue, only keep binaries in the queue
x - remove load_batches option
x - Kalm.profiles settings: heartbeat, threshold, dynamic
x - replace max Packets with max bytes
x - No serializer (null) are defined, just shoot the binary to the handler
x - transmit connection events (event shim it for udp)
x - deterministic uuids
x - Disconnection handler (server)
x - Deprecate SendNow (profile setting)
x - Deprecate SendOnce (Application logic)
x - queue packets when socket is offline
  - Add encryption option
x - fix udp circular dependency
  - fail fast on failed deserialization 
x - only clients own multiplexing
x - validate frame overhead before adding packet in queue


## Leak concerns

- Disconnected clients
- Expired sessions

## Performance targets

- IPC: 20M RPM
- TCP: 40M RPM
- UDP: 70M RPM
