- on/off methods for event listener
- once for channel events
- **Check for leaks**
- Improve browser version where applicable (limit polyfilling)
- in all send methods, can override settings, like encoder
- Encode packets as they enter the queue, only keep binaries in the queue
- remove load_batches option
- Kalm.naggle settings: heartbeat, threshold, dynamic
- replace max Packets with max bytes
- request_id/ transactions 


//
client.send(payload, {
	now: true,
	once: true,
	encoder: 'json',	// Or null if they are already encoded - this is how to properly integrate compactr!
})


client.subscribe('channel', (payload, reply, metadata))

// Metadata
{
	requestId: 'xyz'
	channel: 'xyz'
	client: { ... }
	stats: {
		payload_bytes: 123
		payload_messages: 2
		message_index: 0
