- on/off methods for event listener
- once for channel events
- pool messages until client connects
- udp stream ???
- read connection status 
- **Check for leaks**
- Improve browser version where applicable (limit polyfilling)
- in all send methods, can override settings, like encoder
- Encode packets as they enter the queue, only keep binaries in the queue


//
client.send(payload, {
	now: true,
	once: true,
	encoder: 'json',	// Or null if they are already encoded - this is how to properly integrate compactr!
	delay: 10			// Overrides the channel's timer for this batch
})
